📊 Retail Customer Segmentation using K-Means
🚀 Project Overview
This project applies K-Means Clustering to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase behavior. By identifying distinct customer groups, businesses can optimize marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and enhance overall sales performance.

📌 Key Objectives
✅ Identify different customer segments based on purchasing patterns.
✅ Help businesses personalize marketing strategies.
✅ Improve customer experience through targeted promotions.
✅ Visualize customer clusters for better insights.
